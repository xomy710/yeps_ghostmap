Audience
--------

Package contents are targeted towards scene designers wanting to add foliage with very few draw calls.


Compatibility
-------------

This project was created in Unity 3.3.

In the sample scene, the post processing effects are PRO features so you may encounter errors that you

can ignore in the free version of Unity.


How do I add foliage layers?
----------------------------

Select any game object that has a Mesh, and then click the menu GameObject->Ecosystem->Add Foliage Layer.

You can add a single layer, or the six default layers. The Foliage Panel will open and with the

Mesh game object selected you will be able to tweak the settings.

You will be able to tweak density, random position, orientation, and scale.

Menu Items
----------

GameObject->Ecosystem->Camera Top Down (make the camera face downward)

GameObject->Ecosystem->Add Foliage Layer (adds a single layer)

GameObject->Ecosystem->Add Sample Layers (adds a sample six layers)

Window->Open Ecosystem Panel (opens the Ecosystem panel for docking)
